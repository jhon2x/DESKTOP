1. REMEMBER YOUR VALUE
   - you are need to help the organization
   - lists of good jobs that you've sucessfully done from previous company and how will you
    contribute that to a new company.

      - adding new features
      - creating a module
      - creating an API
      - fixing bugs
      - deploying the website

      My first job in Acidgreen
        - peppermayo
        - designing the account page
          advantage
            * can install magento (locally)
            * slight exp in DIGITAL OCEAN

          disadvantage
          - don't know how to work on frontend such as the ff
            * css/LESS
            * LESS compilation
            * working template with xml
            * don't have experienced in customizing checkout.
            * don't know CAPISTRANO
            * not reading CONFLUENCE
            * don't know JIRRA, ATLASSIAN, BITBUCKET, GIT
            * no experienced in anchor, magemojo
            * don't know ssh
            * don't know how to use MAC/LINUX
            * can't speak english
            * didn't rely on magento documentation
            * reactive style (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tex0zKuLCMg)

            the reason is (reactive)
            - No Plan
            - Unprepared
